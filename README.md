# PowerXaaS
Powershell module for exposing features "as a Service" through a HTTP server

## Description

PowerXaas uses .NET HTTP listener (http.sys) to serve user-defined features as standard REST API web service. 

PowerXaaS will allow you to :
  - create features
  - for each feature, create endpoints
  - add, disable (feature-flag) or remove features/endpoints dynamically with no downtime
  - manage authentication and rights
  - manage several versions of your API
  - validate JSON body based on predefined JSON schema
  - handle HTTP standard errors
  - check how your APIs are used
  - and much more...
